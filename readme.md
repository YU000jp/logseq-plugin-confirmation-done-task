## Overview

Add completed property to the DONE task
> Logseq has a issue where it does not record the `DONE` date. To address this issue, a solution is to add a `completed` property to the block after the task is completed. And embeds a `string` property that allows discovery in queries.
- Mark a task as `DONE`
